   - Verify channel IDs are correct
   - Check bot has read message history permission in achievement channels
   - Ensure messages exist for the specified month

3. **"Guild Setup Issues"**
   - Verify all channel and role IDs in .env
   - Ensure channels and roles exist in the server

4. **Google Sheets errors**
   - Verify service account JSON file is correct
   - Check sheet is shared with service account email
   - Confirm sheet ID is correct

### Logging

Logs are saved to the `logs/` directory:
- `eombot_YYYY-MM-DD.log` - General activity logs
- `eombot_errors_YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Error logs only

### Permission Issues

Ensure the bot has these permissions in relevant channels:
- Read Message History (achievement channels)
